Road Safety 
------

Project 1: Crash Risk Modeling Using Crash Video from Monocular Camera
Member: Junyi Ji and Xiake (Ricardo) Zhu
Aim and Scope:
*Invesitgate the relationship between surrogate safety measurement (mainly the traffic conflict measurements) and crash risk
*Redefine the concept of SSM
*Measure the crash risk of certain merging or diverge segements using the proposed method


Project 2: Traffic Flow Modeling using Video Data
Member: Junyi Ji and Xiake (Ricardo) Zhu
*Typical Circumstancesincluding Abnormal (Beyond Accident-Free, Shockwave) and Mixed (CAV/AV/CV interacted with HV) Traffic Environment

Sustainable Mobility
Project 3: BikeShareIQ: Bike sharing multi-modes market share competition and cooperation relationship identification and quantification
Member and co-authors: Junyi Ji, Jiyang Zhang and Yu (Marco) Nie
Aim and Scope:
*Compare the usage and travel patterns of multi-modal bike sharing systems
*Identify which relationship existed among bike sharing multi-modes -- competition or cooperation
*Quantify to what extend the emerging mode had effect on other existing modes
