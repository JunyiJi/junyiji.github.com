I am currently a **master student** in the [School of Transportation](https://tc.seu.edu.cn/jt_en/) at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm). I am now pursuing my Master degree at [Road Safety Research Team](https://tc.seu.edu.cn/2019/0929/c25692a289881/page.htm). My research interests include road safety, traffic flow theory, sustainable transportation and data modelling.
