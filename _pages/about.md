I am currently a **master student** at [Road Safety Research Team](https://tc.seu.edu.cn/2019/0929/c25692a289881/page.htm) in the [School of Transportation](https://tc.seu.edu.cn/jt_en/) at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm). I earned a Bachelor degree in Traffic Engineering from Southeast University. My research interests include road safety and sustainable transportation. I have served as a volunteer editor since 2017 for *SustainableCity*, a non-profit organization to promote sustainable transportation in China. Recently, I am focusing on the topic of crash risk modelling, trying to mind the research gap between traffic conflicts and traffic collision.
